# House-Tax-Prediction-using-ML
House Tax Prediction using several models , comparing their accuracy levels

#DESCRIPTION
The aim was to develop a model using Random Forest Algorithm however multiple Algorithms were used to check the level of accuracy associated with other Algorithm.
This was done in a way to identify the best model Algorithm for a specific  dataset.

RANDOM FOREST ACCURACY IS -->  97.89302030900305
SGDREGRESSOR REGRESSION ACCURACY IS -->  88.80390622815037
LINEAR REGRESSION ACCURACY IS -->  88.91774178072856
LOGISTIC REGRESSION ACCURACY IS -->  85.6978013591461
